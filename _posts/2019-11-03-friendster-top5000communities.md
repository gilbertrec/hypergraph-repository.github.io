description: "Friendster is an on-line gaming network. Before re-launching as a game website, Friendster was a social networking site where users can form friendship edge each other. Friendster social network also allows users form a group which other members can then join. We consider such user-defined groups as ground-truth communities. For the social network, we take the induced subgraph of the nodes that either belong to at least one community or are connected to other nodes that belong to at least one community. This data is provided by The Web Archive Project, where the full graph is available.
We regard each connected component in a group as a separate ground-truth community. We remove the ground-truth communities which have less than 3 nodes. We also provide the top 5,000 communities with highest quality which are described in our paper. As for the network, we provide the largest connected component."
